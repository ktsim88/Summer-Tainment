                 <p class="text">This was my highlight of my vacation back in June. I actually did a project with a section about this part last year.
                  This trail was a whole journey that changed my life. It made me realize how grateful I am for everything I have.

                      <p class="journey">
                        I did the 5 days and 4 nights version of the trail. My family did this hike through a company called 
                        <a href="https://www.alpacaexpeditions.com/">"Alpaca Expeditions"</a>
                        which is the largest company that does tours in the Inca Trail and other places like "Rainbow Mountain"<br>
                        This is the traditional route to go to Machu Picchu. There are many ruins and plantations along the way.
                      </p>
                      <h5 class="journey">The altitude is 13,828 feet which could often leave people dropping out of the hike due to altitude sickness.</h5>

                       <h3>The Journey</h3>
                        <p class="journey"> We first began the hike which was not too difficult. We actually had cell service for the first half of the day.
                        One person actually had to turn around because he was unable to acclimate before going on this hike. 
                        Once we arrived at the campsite, the porters were settings up the tents for us. There were no showers we were in 
                        a village so there were still proper toilets. The next day was the hardest day of the hike. We were about to go through Dead Woman's Pass. The elevation goes up to 
                        13,828 feet above sea level. It was very difficult but my family made it. Day 3 was rough on the knees and felt that there was no ending to the campsite. Day 4 was the last day of the hike.
                        We saw the Sun Gate which we saw the glimpse of Machu Picchu. Day 5 was the tour in Machu Picchu.
